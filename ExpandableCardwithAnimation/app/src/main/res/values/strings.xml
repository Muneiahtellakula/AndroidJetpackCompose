    <string name="text_name">It is an important property of pyMORâ€™s interfaces that each method either returns
low-dimensional data or new VectorArray, Operator or Discretization objects. This
ensures that no high-dimensional data ever has to be communicated between the external
solver and pyMOR and that no code for handling the solver-specific high-dimensional data
structures has to be added to pyMOR.
